# Neural Codec MUSHRA rating dataset

This dataset of contains MUSHRA ratings of 112 stimuli from 7 (neural) codec conditions (excluding Anchor and Reference conditions). Please feel encouraged to use the dataset in the development of speecvh quality assessment systems.

The raw MUSHRA ratings and participant IDs can be found in `ratings_formated_filtered.csv` / `ratings_formated.csv` (participants that rated the reference with less than 90 points in more than one of eight trials were removed from the former).
